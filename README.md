This repo will contain some notebooks and scripts to explore the relationship between the bit and the embedding as auxiliary material for the article ["Cosine Capital: Large Language Models and the Embedding of All Things"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517251386055). The article came out sooner than I had expected, so still working on this complementary material but I should have it out by the end of October 2025. Thanks for your patience!
